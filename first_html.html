My name is Charlie. <br>
I'm majoring in either Psychology or Cognitive Brain Science. <br>
My IP address is 130.64.93.48 <br>
I grew up in New York City. <br>
Something no one would expect about me is that I do research about
chimpanzee behavior. <br>
My favorite place in the world is the canyons of Utah: <br>
