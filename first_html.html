<h1 > Welcome to my website! </h1>
<p>

My name is <strong> Charlie. </strong> <br> <br>
I'm majoring in <strong> either Psychology or Cognitive Brain Science.
</strong> <br> <br>
My IP address is <strong> 130.64.93.48 </strong> <br> <br>
I grew up in <strong> New York City. </strong> <br> <br>
Something no one would expect about me is that <strong> I do research on
chimpanzee behavior. </strong> <br> <br>
My favorite place in the world is <strong> the canyons of Utah,
</strong> but I took a photo from the internet because my own photos could
never do them justice: <br> <br> <br>
